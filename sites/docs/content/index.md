After spending a ton of time building documentation sites for various projects, we decided to build a starter template that we could use for future projects. This template is the result of that effort.

This template is a starting point we use for projects under the [Svecosystem](https://github.com/svecosystem) umbrella. The code is open source, but it's built and maintained for our own needs, so we won't be accepting any public feature requests or handling any issues related to this project.

Feel free to fork the project and customize it to your own needs, or use it as a starting point for your own documentation site. We've tried to make it as easy as possible to customize the template, and we've documented some of the more common customizations throughout this site.

## Features

- **Markdown-based docs**. Write docs using Markdown and Svelte components
- **Light and dark mode**. Toggle between light and dark mode
- **Syntax highlighting**. Code blocks are automatically highlighted
- **SEO-friendly**. Meta tags and Open Graph support out of the box
- **Pre-built components**. Tabs, callouts, and more to use within the documentation
- **Custom unified plugins**. Custom remark and rehype plugins to give more flexibility over the rendered HTML
- **Tailwind CSS**. A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **shadcn-svelte**. Beautifully designed Svelte components

<Callout>
The docs for this template contain just enough for someone contributing to a Svecosystem project to get started. It's not meant to be a comprehensive guide to forking and customizing the template. However, we hope the code is easy enough to follow that you can figure out how to customize it to your own needs!
