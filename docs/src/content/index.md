After spending countless hours building documentation sites for various projects, we decided to build a docs package/starter template that we can use for future projects. This project is a result of that effort.

Svecodocs is a starting point/utility library for building documentation sites under the [Svecosystem](https://github.com/svecosystem) umbrella. The code is open source, but it's built and maintained for our own specific needs, so we won't be accepting any public feature requests.

You are more than welcome to fork the project and customize it to your own needs.

## Features

- **Markdown-based docs**. Write docs using Markdown and Svelte components
- **Light and dark mode**. Toggle between light and dark mode

- **SEO-friendly**. Meta tags and Open Graph support out of the box
- **Pre-built components**. Tabs, callouts, and more to use within the documentation
- **Custom unified plugins**. Custom remark and rehype plugins to give more flexibility over the rendered HTML
- **shadcn-svelte**. Beautifully designed Svelte components
- **Tailwind v4**. Tailwind CSS v4 is used for styling
