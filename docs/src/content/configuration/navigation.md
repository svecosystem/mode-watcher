Navigation is a key component of every site, documenting the structure of your site and providing a clear path for users to navigate through your content.

Svecodocs comes with a navigation structure that is designed to be flexible and customizable. Each page in your site should have a corresponding navigation item, and the navigation items should be nested according to their hierarchy.

## Navigation Structure

### Anchors

Anchors are links that are displayed at the top of the sidebar and typically used to either highlight important information or provide quick access to linked content.

### Sections

Sections are used to group related navigation items together. They are typically used to organize content into different categories, such as "Components", "Configuration", and "Utilities".
